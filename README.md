# Feature Flag Toolkit

>This is an Excella Consultant Productivity Toolkit - it is intended to provide guidance and assistance to Excella's consultants. If you are a member of the Excella community, feel free to contribute!

## Overview

[Excella](https://www.excella.com/) is committed to **Continuous and Progressive Development** of software for our clients. One of the key components of Progressive Delivery is _Feature Flags_ (also known as _Feature Toggles_), the ability to dynamically enable and disable functionality of an application. This toolkit provides examples for developers on how to implement this pattern.

For a more thorough overview of Feature Flags, refer to [FeatureFlags.io](https://featureflags.io/)

## Platform

Excella is a polyglot organization - we support multiple programming languages and stacks. For a generalized Feature Flag solution, we are looking for an _open-source, deployable, and language-agnostic_ service. Our current solution of choice is [Flagr](https://checkr.github.io/flagr/). Flagr is a standalone service with both a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) interface and a simple graphical user interface.

In this repository you will find examples of how to integrate with Flagr in the following languages:


* [Java](https://github.com/excellaco/feature-flag-toolkit/blob/master/java/README.md)
* [.NET](https://github.com/excellaco/feature-flag-toolkit/blob/master/dotnet/README.md)
* [Python](https://github.com/excellaco/feature-flag-toolkit/blob/master/python/README.md)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/excellaco/feature-flag-toolkit/blob/master/ruby/README.md)
